      <h3>Our Achievements in 2022</h3>
      <p>
        As a part of an extremely dynamic economic environment where competition
        keeps us on our toes, we are proud to share such remarkable results.
      </p>

        <h4>Company Achievements in Customer Service</h4>
        <p>
          We are proud to attain a Bank Account Opening Success Rate of 99% in
          the UAE – keeping industry standards in mind, this is the highest.
          Investors who have tried opening corporate bank account would know
          that it is not an easy process these days. Many applications are
          declined because of inadequate knowledge of the documents or
          procedures. This is why professional support is such a high demand.
          Our Project Management System also witnessed a considerable
          transformation which was aimed at optimizing and improving the system
          which resulted in reduced financial costs towards stationeries and
          also increased the efficiency of the organization by reducing the
          length of time spent in each client interaction.

        <p>
          We are glad to have been able to connect with more than 1 million
          people through our social media posts. Our goal is to help more people
          know about the business environment of the UAE and help them
          understand the regulations for setting up business in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          With more than 3,500 followers on various social media platforms and
          over 150,000 views on our corporate videos, we know that our goals are
          being realized.

      <h3>What are Our Company Goals?</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Moving to the Inside of the Track</h4>
        <p>
          Beyond understanding the goals of the organization, teams must be
          consistently analyzing the track to determine how to move into the
          shortest lane. While the journey to success is often riddled with
          meandering paths, the most successful teams are continuously analyzing
          market conditions to align their activities in ways that shorten the
          path to success. Why take the long road when you can take the short
          one? That shift requires insight and input from each runner on the
          team; they best understand the landscape and strengths that can be
          leveraged to gain a competitive edge.

        <h4>Takeaway</h4>
        <p>
          If you’re concerned that your team may not be in sync on the race to
          the finish line, simply ask each team member to identify one key
          organizational goal in your next face-to-face meeting. If your team
          members can’t even list one, or look at your with a
          ‘deer-in-the-headlights’ stare, it’s probably time to put that
          external microscope away and start preparing some content and training
          that will get your team on the same page; only then will your runners
          even be running in the same direction. You can worry about
          implementing design thinking later.
        </p>

        <h4>Regaining Alignment</h4>
        <p>
          Correcting this problem requires a pivot to a more substantial focus
          on internal reflection. As individual performance assessments are
          completed each year, so to should team performance assessments that
          evaluate team dynamics, alignment, and culture. Many current team
          assessments evaluate only the achievement of key performance
          indicators which are often revenue and customer satisfaction focused.
          Teams must dig deep, collectively, to better understand the internal
          contributors to goal hits and misses. Only then will organizations
          truly uncover internal breakdowns such as lack of organizational goal
          understanding.
